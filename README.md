# Week 15 - Technigo Bootcamp

# Project Labyrinth

In this week's project, you'll be building a project which allows a user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend.

The goal for this week is to use the API specified to build a frontend which gives the user control over what to do next. You'll focus on using thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.  Beyond that, you'll have a lot of freedom.

This week's project comes in the form of a text-based adventure. Classic games like this usually present the user with a description of where they are and provide several alternatives about what they can do.

## The problem

This week I started designing the game, and what I wanted to show. I read carefully what I get from the backend and based on that I designed the functions and the store. I used fake data to design the CSS and then I used the functions to get the info and understand the logic of the game. Once the logic and the maze were working, I decided to finish the design of the app.
