# Week 15 - Technigo Bootcamp

# Project Labyrinth

In this week's project, you'll be building a project which allows a user to navigate a maze, in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend.

The goal for this week is to use the API specified to build a frontend which gives the user control over what to do next. You'll focus on using thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.  Beyond that, you'll have a lot of freedom.

This week's project comes in the form of a text-based adventure. Classic games like this usually present the user with a description of where they are and provide several alternatives about what they can do.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
